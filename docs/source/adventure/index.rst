Exploring Manim's Capabilities
##############################

=============
What is this?
=============

One of the hardest parts of learning how to use manim is to deviate from the quickstart and basic examples given in the documentation,
to carving your own path without anyones help. The goal of this guide is to give an example of how you might achieve that, with the help
of the documentation and your own brain.

--------------------
Part One: The Basics
--------------------

Here we talk about the basics: what are Mobjects, Animations, Groups, Updaters, etc. It gives many examples of the theoretical minimum amount of knowledge
one might need to start utilizing manim to create their own animations. It offers a cohesize guide of examples not provided elsewhere in the documentation,
and encourages you to test your understanding by recreating certain sequences of animations. Feel free to return to this section anytime you need a refresher
on something during part two,

---------------------
Part Two: The Project
---------------------

Here is the fun part. We go through and make our own creation from start to finish, explaining how to search the documentation, come up with coding logic
to make your ideas come alive and much more. By the end of this section, you should be fully prepared to tackle your own project.
