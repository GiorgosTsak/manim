Exploring Manim's Capabilities
##############################

=============
What is this?
=============

One of the hardest parts of learning how to use Manim is to deviate from the quickstart and basic examples given in the documentation,
and coding your own animation. By the end of this, you should have had some experience learning how to go about with this!

--------------------
Part One: The Basics
--------------------

Here we talk about the basics: what are Mobjects, Animations, Groups, Updaters, and many other basic aspects of Manim. It gives many examples
about each concept, and encourages you to test your understanding by recreating certain sequences of animations.
Feel free to return to this section anytime you need a refresher on something during part two.

---------------------
Part Two: The Project
---------------------

.. note:: As of right now, this section is still under construction.


Here is the fun part: We go through and make our own creation from start to finish, explaining how to effectively search the documentation,
and come up with the logic to make your ideas come to life. By the end of this section, you should be fully prepared to tackle your own project.
